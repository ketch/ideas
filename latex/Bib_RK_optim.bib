	abstract = {In an earlier paper [Albrecht, {SIAM} J. Numer. Anal., 24 (1987), pp. 391–406] Runge–Kutta methods were treated as (composite) linear methods. The resulting linear theory is elementary yielding the order conditions as orthogonal relations from a recursion. This paper further extends this approach and discusses its implications. It is extended to Fehlberg forms, and the global as well as the stage errors are given in great detail, including a new presentation of the principal error function that simplifies error minimization. The orthogonal structure of the order conditions has many advantages; it provides, in particular, a powerful strategy for existence proofs and facilitates the calculation of {RK}-methods. The recursion, which, originally, was designed to generate the order conditions, is considerably generalized by mappings and becomes a major tool also for the classical theory It can be used for a recursive generation of rooted trees; also Butcher’s elementary differentials and weights as well as his order conditions can be obtained recursively. To this purpose, the elementary weights are reformulated, and the rooted trees are complemented by “blossoms” The whole approach extends to Rosenbrock methods.},

	series = {Springer Series in Computational Mathematics},
	abstract = {This book describes numerical methods for partial differential equations ({PDEs}) coupling advection, diffusion and reaction terms, encompassing methods for hyperbolic, parabolic and stiff and nonstiff ordinary differential equations ({ODEs}). The emphasis lies on time-dependent transport-chemistry problems, describing e.g. the evolution of concentrations in environmental and biological applications. Along with the common topics of stability and convergence, much attention is paid on how to prevent spurious, negative concentrations and oscillations, both in space and time. Many of the theoretical aspects are illustrated by numerical experiments on models from biology, chemistry and physics. A unified approach is followed by emphasizing the method of lines or semi-discretization. In this regard this book differs substantially from more specialized textbooks which deal exclusively with either {PDEs} or {ODEs}. This book treats integration methods suitable for both classes of problems and thus is of interest to {PDE} researchers unfamiliar with advanced numerical {ODE} methods, as well as to {ODE} researchers unaware of the vast amount of interesting results on numerical {PDEs}. The first chapter provides a self-contained introduction to the field and can be used for an undergraduate course on the numerical solution of {PDEs}. The remaining four chapters are more specialized and of interest to researchers, practitioners and graduate students from numerical mathematics, scientific computing, computational physics and other computational sciences.},

	abstract = {Convex optimization problems arise frequently in many different fields. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the subject, and shows in detail how such problems can be solved numerically with great efficiency. The book begins with the basic elements of convex sets and functions, and then describes various classes of convex optimization problems. Duality and approximation techniques are then covered, as are statistical estimation techniques. Various geometrical problems are then presented, and there is detailed discussion of unconstrained and constrained minimization problems, and interior-point methods. The focus of the book is on recognizing convex optimization problems and then finding the most appropriate technique for solving them. It contains many worked examples and homework exercises and will appeal to students, researchers and practitioners in fields such as engineering, computer science, mathematics, statistics, finance and economics.},
