	abstract = {We study spatially partitioned embedded Runge--Kutta ({SPERK}) schemes for partial differential equations ({PDEs}), in which each of the component schemes is applied over a different part of the spatial domain. Such methods may be convenient for problems in which the smoothness of the solution or the magnitudes of the {PDE} coefficients vary strongly in space.  We focus on embedded partitioned methods as they offer greater efficiency and avoid the order reduction that may occur in nonembedded schemes.  We demonstrate that the lack of conservation in partitioned schemes can lead to nonphysical effects and propose conservative additive schemes based on partitioning the fluxes rather than the ordinary differential equations. A variety of {SPERK} schemes are presented, including an embedded pair suitable for the time evolution of fifth-order weighted nonoscillatory  spatial discretizations. Numerical experiments are provided to support the theory.},

	abstract = {In an earlier paper [Albrecht, {SIAM} J. Numer. Anal., 24 (1987), pp. 391–406] Runge–Kutta methods were treated as (composite) linear methods. The resulting linear theory is elementary yielding the order conditions as orthogonal relations from a recursion. This paper further extends this approach and discusses its implications. It is extended to Fehlberg forms, and the global as well as the stage errors are given in great detail, including a new presentation of the principal error function that simplifies error minimization. The orthogonal structure of the order conditions has many advantages; it provides, in particular, a powerful strategy for existence proofs and facilitates the calculation of {RK}-methods. The recursion, which, originally, was designed to generate the order conditions, is considerably generalized by mappings and becomes a major tool also for the classical theory It can be used for a recursive generation of rooted trees; also Butcher’s elementary differentials and weights as well as his order conditions can be obtained recursively. To this purpose, the elementary weights are reformulated, and the rooted trees are complemented by “blossoms” The whole approach extends to Rosenbrock methods.},

Concerning prerequisites, it is assumed that the words just written have meaning for you, that you have some knowledge of numerical methods, and that you already know {MATLAB}. If you like computing and numerical mathematics, you will enjoy working through this book, whether alone or in the classroom—and if you learn a few new tricks of {MATLAB} along the way, that's {OK} too!},

	abstract = {This book will take you on a thrilling tour of some of the most important and powerful areas of contemporary numerical mathematics. A first unusual feature is that the tour is organized by problems, not methods : it is extremely valuable to realize that numerical problems often yield to a wide variety of methods. For example, we solve a random-walk problem (Chapter 6) by several different techniques, such as large-scale linear algebra, a three-term recursion obtained by symbolic computations, elliptic integrals and the arithmetic-geometric mean, and Fourier analysis. We do so in {IEEE} arithmetic to full accuracy and, at the extreme, in high-precision arithmetic to get 10,000 digits. A second unusual feature is that we very carefully try to justify the validity of every single digit of a numerical answer, using methods ranging from carefully designed computer experiments and a posteriori error estimates to computer-assisted proofs based on interval arithmetic. In the real world, the first two methods are usually adequate and give the desired confidence in the answer. Interval methods, while nicely rigorous, would most often not provide any additional benefit. Yet it sometimes happens that one of the best approaches to a problem is one that provides proof along the way (this occurs in Chapter 4), a point that has considerable mathematical interest. A main theme of the book is that there are usually two options for solving a numerical problem: either use a brute force method running overnight and unsupervised on a high-performance workstation with lots of memory, or spend your days thinking harder, with the help of mathematical theory and a good library, in the hope of coming up with a clever method that will solve the problem in less than a second on common hardware. Of course, in practice these two options of attacking a problem will scale differently with problem size and difficulty, and your choice will depend on such resources as your time, interest, and knowledge and the computer power at your disposal. One noteworthy case, where a detour guided by theory leads to an approach that is ultimately much more efficient than the direct path, is illustrated on the cover of this book. That diagram (taken from Chapter 1) illustrates that many problems about real numbers can be made much, much easier by stepping outside the real axis and taking a route through the complex plane.},

They adapt explicit Runge–Kutta schemes to ensure positivity and conservation irrespective of the time step size. The first two members of this class, the first order {MPE} scheme and the second order {MPRK}22(1) scheme, have been successfully applied in a large number of applications. Recently, a general definition of {MPRK} schemes was introduced and necessary as well as sufficient conditions to obtain first and second order {MPRK} schemes were presented. In this paper we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for third order {MPRK} schemes and introduce the first family of such schemes. The theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments considering linear and nonlinear as well as nonstiff and stiff systems of differential equations.},
