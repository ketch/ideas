	abstract = {We study spatially partitioned embedded Runge--Kutta ({SPERK}) schemes for partial differential equations ({PDEs}), in which each of the component schemes is applied over a different part of the spatial domain. Such methods may be convenient for problems in which the smoothness of the solution or the magnitudes of the {PDE} coefficients vary strongly in space.  We focus on embedded partitioned methods as they offer greater efficiency and avoid the order reduction that may occur in nonembedded schemes.  We demonstrate that the lack of conservation in partitioned schemes can lead to nonphysical effects and propose conservative additive schemes based on partitioning the fluxes rather than the ordinary differential equations. A variety of {SPERK} schemes are presented, including an embedded pair suitable for the time evolution of fifth-order weighted nonoscillatory  spatial discretizations. Numerical experiments are provided to support the theory.},

	abstract = {In an earlier paper [Albrecht, {SIAM} J. Numer. Anal., 24 (1987), pp. 391–406] Runge–Kutta methods were treated as (composite) linear methods. The resulting linear theory is elementary yielding the order conditions as orthogonal relations from a recursion. This paper further extends this approach and discusses its implications. It is extended to Fehlberg forms, and the global as well as the stage errors are given in great detail, including a new presentation of the principal error function that simplifies error minimization. The orthogonal structure of the order conditions has many advantages; it provides, in particular, a powerful strategy for existence proofs and facilitates the calculation of {RK}-methods. The recursion, which, originally, was designed to generate the order conditions, is considerably generalized by mappings and becomes a major tool also for the classical theory It can be used for a recursive generation of rooted trees; also Butcher’s elementary differentials and weights as well as his order conditions can be obtained recursively. To this purpose, the elementary weights are reformulated, and the rooted trees are complemented by “blossoms” The whole approach extends to Rosenbrock methods.},

They adapt explicit Runge–Kutta schemes to ensure positivity and conservation irrespective of the time step size. The first two members of this class, the first order {MPE} scheme and the second order {MPRK}22(1) scheme, have been successfully applied in a large number of applications. Recently, a general definition of {MPRK} schemes was introduced and necessary as well as sufficient conditions to obtain first and second order {MPRK} schemes were presented. In this paper we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for third order {MPRK} schemes and introduce the first family of such schemes. The theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments considering linear and nonlinear as well as nonstiff and stiff systems of differential equations.},

	abstract = {This book describes numerical methods for partial differential equations ({PDEs}) coupling advection, diffusion and reaction terms, encompassing methods for hyperbolic, parabolic and stiff and nonstiff ordinary differential equations ({ODEs}). The emphasis lies on time-dependent transport-chemistry problems, describing e.g. the evolution of concentrations in environmental and biological applications. Along with the common topics of stability and convergence, much attention is paid on how to prevent spurious, negative concentrations and oscillations, both in space and time. Many of the theoretical aspects are illustrated by numerical experiments on models from biology, chemistry and physics. A unified approach is followed by emphasizing the method of lines or semi-discretization. In this regard this book differs substantially from more specialized textbooks which deal exclusively with either {PDEs} or {ODEs}. This book treats integration methods suitable for both classes of problems and thus is of interest to {PDE} researchers unfamiliar with advanced numerical {ODE} methods, as well as to {ODE} researchers unaware of the vast amount of interesting results on numerical {PDEs}. The first chapter provides a self-contained introduction to the field and can be used for an undergraduate course on the numerical solution of {PDEs}. The remaining four chapters are more specialized and of interest to researchers, practitioners and graduate students from numerical mathematics, scientific computing, computational physics and other computational sciences.},
